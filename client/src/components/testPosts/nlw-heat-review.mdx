# What I've learned from NLW Heat Origin

---

#### Quick summary

NLW Heat is a kind of boot camp for different levels of developers, so it has different routes.

- route 1: Origin(the one i completed), for beginners.
- route 2: Impulse, for intermediate level developers.
- route 3: Expanse, for already experienced developers.

Note- NLW Heat is a Brazilian event.

# Review

I guess this route i took is really cool for the true beginners that didn't have touch with HTML, CSS and JavaScript at all, unlike the time that Jakeliny Gracielly, one of the teachers of this route(her classes were very didactic, to be honest), didn't talk about the `document.querySelector()` , which selects any Tags,Id's, Classes, and only talked about `document.getElementById()`, that nowadays isn't that much good practice considering we are already on ES6 and it was introduced in 2013. Overall, because this event is meant to be a kind of boot camp, it's cool for anyone to experience different projects and also gain more experience.

# What I've Learned

To be honest, I started this course already thinking I knew more than the Origin route, but I gave it a try. The only thing i really did learn was getting information with `fetch()`, from an API, for example, GitHub, and `then()`, to convert the data to a JSON file, to enable JavaScript to read it correctly,and `then()` again to use the data, I found it really cool because this code is flexible for any person that wants to do the same project as me, just changing the variables to his information and the link from GitHub's API to his profile will do the work. That was my first experience with API usage.
